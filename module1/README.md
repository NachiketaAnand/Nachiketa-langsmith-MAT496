1. Tracing Basics:
Tracing is a key concept in LangSmith that helps you record and visualize every action your LLM performs. At the heart of this is a Run, which represents a single action, like calling a function, invoking a model, or retrieving data. Each Run logs details such as its name, input and output, type, timing, and other relevant information. When you combine all Runs, you get a Trace, or Run Tree, showing how smaller Runs fit together in a hierarchy. This view is essential for debugging. A Project sits at the top level, grouping multiple Traces to represent an entire application or deployment environment.

2. Types of Runs:
LangSmith organizes actions using different Run Types to make analysis and debugging easier. For instance, LLM Runs track interactions with external models, Chain Runs group sequences of steps, and Retriever Runs log document fetching. There are also Runs for external tools, prompt generation, and parsing outputs into structured formats. These classifications help you understand what each part of your system is doing and diagnose issues more efficiently.

3. Conversational Threads:
A Conversational Thread, sometimes called a session, groups all traces from a single user interaction. This is especially useful for chat applications, where a conversation is a back-and-forth rather than a single question and answer. By linking all traces from a session, you can see the full flow of interaction, which is crucial for debugging problems that appear over time, like models losing context or generating errors after several turns.

4. Alternative Tracing Methods:
While frameworks like LangChain and LangGraph can automatically handle tracing, you can also add tracing manually. A decorator can log entire functions automatically, a context manager can trace specific blocks of code, helper functions can log external API calls, and manually managing a RunTree gives you full control over when runs start and end and what data is recorded. These options let you tailor tracing to your specific needs.
