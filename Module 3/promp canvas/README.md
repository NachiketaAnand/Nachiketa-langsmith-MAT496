In this lesson, we used the Prompt Canvas to design a chatbot with the persona of a football player. We added formatted fields for the player’s name and club, and created a custom quick action called “Egotistical,” which made the chatbot boast about its stats whenever possible. Through this exercise, we learned how the Prompt Canvas helps structure personality-driven prompts, how quick actions can be layered to control behavior, and how LLMs can maintain tone and consistency through effective prompt design.
