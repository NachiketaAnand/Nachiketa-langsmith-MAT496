In this lesson, we replaced the previous traceable example with a complete RAG setup. We refined the system prompt to produce concise answers that include code snippets or helpful tips when appropriate. After that, we created and saved a LangSmith dataset, imported it into the notebook, and executed the RAG pipeline using that dataset to generate and evaluate responses end to end.
