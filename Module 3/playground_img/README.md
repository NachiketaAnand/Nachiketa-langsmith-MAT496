In this section of the video, I learned about the Playground. In the Playground, we can experiment with different LLMs without writing full code manually. In my first image, I asked ChatGPT, “Who’s Elon Musk?” In the second image, I instructed GPT that “he’s Tim Cook” and then asked when the first iPhone was released. In the third and fourth images, I used the LangChain Playground to teach a language model how to answer questions in a very specific, brief manner by showing it examples. In the fourth image, I instructed it to act as an artist and poet, so its reply came in a poetic style.
